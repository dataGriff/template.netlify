# Contributing to SlopStopper

> 📌 **This guide is for contributors to the SlopStopper project itself.**

Thanks for considering a contribution. The full contributor guide lives at:

→ [`docs/contributing/README.md`](./docs/contributing/README.md)

## Short version

- Branch from `main` and keep changes focused
- Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):
  `<type>(<scope>): <description>` (types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`,
  `test`, `chore`, `refactor`)
- Run `task --list` to see check tasks before pushing
- The Taskfile is the single source of truth — `task <name>` runs the same
  thing locally that CI runs
- Open a pull request; the SlopStopper checks will report back

## Quick checks before pushing

```bash
task contributing:build                  # TypeScript build
task contributing:test                   # Playwright smoke + a11y
task ss:reliability:accessibility        # axe-core WCAG 2.1 AA
task ss:hygiene:complexity               # Lizard cap
task ss:security:sast                    # Semgrep
```

The fast hygiene subset (`task ss:hygiene:test`) also runs automatically as a
**pre-push hook** once you've run `task contributing:setup` (it points
`core.hooksPath` at [`.githooks/`](./.githooks)). That gate catches the cheap,
deterministic issues before they reach CI — the checks above still cover the
server/browser layers the hook deliberately skips. Bypass a single push with
`git push --no-verify`.
