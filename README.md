# SlopStopper

**Portable code-quality suite — security, hygiene, reliability, accessibility, performance, operational automation.** Delivered as a Python CLI (`slopstopper-cli`) plus a small set of GitHub Actions workflows that drive it.

## Install

The CLI alone (most use cases):

```bash
pipx install slopstopper-cli
slopstopper checks list             # see what's available
slopstopper doctor                  # verify the external tools you'll need
slopstopper run hygiene:docs-size   # run a check (writes .ss/reports/...)
```

> Published to PyPI on every release tag. Each release is also attached to [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/hungovercoders/slopstopper/releases/latest) with a Sigstore build-provenance attestation — verify with `gh attestation verify <wheel> --owner hungovercoders`.

The full suite into a repo (CLI + GitHub Actions workflows + Taskfile shim + config seed):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hungovercoders/slopstopper/main/install.sh | bash
```

`install.sh` is idempotent — re-run to refresh workflows. It **pins** `slopstopper-cli` in `mise.toml` and installs it via [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev), so a breaking release only lands when you move the pin. See [Update](#update).

> 🗺️ **Documentation map:** [`docs/index.md`](./docs/index.md) is the single index of all project documentation. This README, [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md) and [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md) are deliberately thin entry points — all three defer to the map.

## Prerequisites

mise pins + installs `slopstopper-cli`; each check subprocess-invokes its own tool (`semgrep`, `gitleaks`, `trivy`, `lizard`, `docker`, `node`). `slopstopper doctor` reports what's missing.

- **[mise](https://mise.jdx.dev)** — required; installs the pinned `slopstopper-cli` + `task`, activated per-directory (CI uses `jdx/mise-action`)
- **Python 3.11+** — mise's pipx backend needs it on PATH

Per-check tools (skip if you've disabled the check):

| Tool | Needed by | Install hint |
| ---- | --------- | ------------ |
| `node` 20+ | Reliability checks (Playwright + Lighthouse), `slopstopper serve` | [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) |
| `gh` | `slopstopper emit` (PR comments + issues from CI) | [cli.github.com](https://cli.github.com/) |
| `lizard` | `hygiene:complexity` | `pip install --user lizard` (**not** brew — that's lz4) |
| `semgrep` | `security:sast` | `pip install --user semgrep` |
| `gitleaks` | `security:secrets` | `brew install gitleaks` |
| `trivy` | `security:vulnerability:all` | `brew install aquasecurity/trivy/trivy` |
| `docker` | `security:dast` | [docs.docker.com/get-docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) |

Optional: **bash + git** (if using `install.sh`), **Task v3.x** (for the `task ss:*` shim layer).

## What gets installed

Everything SlopStopper owns lives under the `ss` namespace so it can't clash with files you already have.

| Item | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `slopstopper-cli` (Python) | The product — every check runs through this. Pinned per-repo in `mise.toml` (`"pipx:slopstopper-cli"`) and installed via mise; move the pin with `install.sh --upgrade-cli`. |
| `.github/workflows/ss-*.yml` | Security, hygiene, reliability and operational workflows — all `ss-` prefixed |
| `Taskfile.ss.yml` | Thin `task ss:*` shims that call the CLI — convenient for the local dev loop |
| `Taskfile.yml` | Created if missing (else: prints the include block to paste in) |
| `.githooks/pre-push` | Runs `task ss:hygiene:test` pre-push (via `core.hooksPath`). Opt out with `--no-hooks`; skipped if you already run husky/lefthook/pre-commit |
| `mise.toml` | Toolchain pin — `"pipx:slopstopper-cli"` + `task`; read locally + in CI (`jdx/mise-action`). Moves via `--upgrade-cli`/`--cli-version` |
| `.slopstopper.yml` | Config seed — URLs, headers, thresholds, page lists (never overwritten) |
| `.ss/reports/` | Where the CLI writes reports — `.gitignore`d |
| `package.json` | Created (or `devDependencies` merged into an existing file) |

Bundled Playwright specs, lighthouserc dev/prod, and the local-CI static server live inside the wheel — `slopstopper templates eject <name>` copies one into `.ss/` to customise.

## What you get

Five loops of feedback, all running on every PR and push to `main`:

| Loop | What it does | Tools | Docs |
| ---- | ------------ | ----- | ---- |
| 🔒 **Security** | SAST, DAST, secrets detection, dependency CVE scanning | Semgrep, OWASP ZAP, Gitleaks, Trivy | [Security →](./docs/security/README.md) |
| 🧹 **Hygiene** | Cyclomatic complexity caps, doc structure/accuracy/size checks, auto-labelled PRs | Lizard, Bandit, markdownlint | [Hygiene →](./docs/hygiene/README.md) |
| ✅ **Reliability** | E2E + smoke tests, broken-link audits, accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA), Core Web Vitals, SEO metatags, llms.txt, robots.txt | Playwright, axe-core, Lighthouse CI, stdlib Python | [Reliability →](./docs/reliability/README.md) |
| 🤖 **Runbooks** | Failed workflows auto-raise GitHub issues; an agentic doc updater opens weekly sync PRs | GitHub Actions, gh-aw | [Runbooks →](./docs/runbooks/README.md) |
| 🚀 **Deployment** | Preview deploys per PR, automated production releases, automatic preview cleanup | Cloudflare Workers Builds (Git integration) | [Deployment →](./docs/deployment/README.md) |

## What each check needs

Three portability layers. Layer 1 runs on install; layers 2–3 need a little config:

| Layer | Checks | What you provide |
| ----- | ------ | ---------------- |
| **1. Static analysis** (any code) | SAST, Secrets, Trivy, Dependency Review, Complexity, Doc Structure / Accuracy / Size, Auto-label PRs, Workflow-failure tracker | Nothing — works out of the box |
| **2. Web-app dynamic** (need a URL) | Smoke, Broken Links, Accessibility, Core Web Vitals, SEO Metatags, llms.txt, robots.txt, DAST, Playwright | `SMOKE_TEST_URL` · `BROKEN_LINKS_TEST_URL` · `ACCESSIBILITY_TEST_URL` · `LIGHTHOUSE_URL` · `SEO_TEST_URL` · optionally `*_PAGES` env vars |
| **3. Agentic doc-updater** | Weekly doc-sync PRs | `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` repo secret |

Don't use the doc-updater? Delete its workflows from `.github/workflows/` — re-running the installer respects deletions (tracked in `.ss/.workflows-installed`).

Deploy is intentionally not a layer: connect your repo in the Cloudflare dash for production deploys, PR previews and preview cleanup. See [Deployment](./docs/deployment/README.md).

## Same commands, both loops

`task ss:<category>:<check>` is the canonical interface — humans, agents and CI all go through it, so the suite shares one invocation surface with the rest of your codebase. The shims call `slopstopper-cli` under the hood; pass `--no-task` to `install.sh` to skip Task and have workflows call the CLI directly.

```bash
task ss:hygiene:complexity                    # the canonical form
task ss:reliability:accessibility -- http://localhost:8080
task ss:security:sast                         # CI runs the same line
slopstopper run hygiene:complexity            # underlying CLI if you skip Task
```

## Configure

Most checks work out of the box. To wire up the full suite:

**[`.slopstopper.yml`](./.slopstopper.yml.example)** at the repo root is the canonical config carrier. `install.sh` seeds a starter file (`headers.source: null`, empty URLs) so the first PR is green; opt knobs in by editing it. Survives reinstalls.

**Repo secrets** (under Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions):

- `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` — for the agentic doc-updater, a [gh-aw](https://github.github.com/gh-aw/) workflow. Setup: [`docs/hygiene/DOC_UPDATER.md`](./docs/hygiene/DOC_UPDATER.md).

Deploy needs no secrets — Cloudflare Workers Builds connects via the GitHub App.

**Tuning files** (`.slopstopper.yml` covers most config; these handle the rest):

- Complexity gate — CCN > 10 threshold in `.github/workflows/ss-hygiene-complexity-check.yml`
- Lighthouse budgets — bundled in `cli/slopstopper/data/lighthouserc{,.prod}.json`; override via `.ss/`
- Doc size thresholds — `hygiene.docs_size.*` keys in [`.slopstopper.yml.example`](./.slopstopper.yml.example)

## Update

Refresh workflows + shims and reinstall the **pinned** `slopstopper-cli` (config + customisations survive):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hungovercoders/slopstopper/main/install.sh | bash
```

Move the pin when ready (rewrites `mise.toml`; commit so CI matches). See [docs/runbooks/UPGRADE_CLI.md](docs/runbooks/UPGRADE_CLI.md):

```bash
bash install.sh --upgrade-cli        # latest
bash install.sh --cli-version X.Y.Z  # exact
```

## Contribute

Contributions are welcome. The full contributor guide lives in [`docs/contributing/README.md`](./docs/contributing/README.md) — short version:

- Branch from `main`, keep changes focused
- Run `slopstopper checks list` to see what's available
- Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
- Open a PR; let the SlopStopper checks do their job

## Agents

If an AI agent (Claude, Copilot, Cursor, etc.) is working on this repo, the canonical conventions live in [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md). [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md) imports `AGENTS.md` so Claude Code picks up the same instructions automatically.

**Using Claude Code?** `install.sh` lands [`slopstopper-install`](./.claude/skills/slopstopper-install/SKILL.md) (install + refresh) and [`slopstopper-triage`](./.claude/skills/slopstopper-triage/SKILL.md) at `<repo>/.claude/skills/`, so every contributor gets them on clone. `--no-skills` opts out. Refresh:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hungovercoders/slopstopper/main/install-skill.sh | bash
```
